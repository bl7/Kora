# SalesSuite Branding and Naming

Use these rules as the **single source of truth** for product naming, logo usage, and brand basics across the project.

## Product and Company Names

- **Primary product name (use almost everywhere)**: `SalesSuite`
- **Optional short label** (only when space is very tight, e.g. tiny badges): `SS`
- **Legal company name** (footer & legal contexts only): `Gopala Sales Management Pvt Ltd`

## Capitalization and Spelling

- **Correct**: `SalesSuite`
  - Example sentence: “SalesSuite verifies visits and captures orders.”
- **Incorrect — do NOT use**:
  - `Salessuite`
  - `Sales suite`
  - `SalesSuites` / `Sales suites`
  - `SSS`

## Where to Use Each Name

- **UI, marketing copy, emails, dashboard, headings, CTA text, meta tags**:
  - Use **`SalesSuite`** only.
- **Legal / compliance surfaces only**:
  - Website footer
  - Terms of Service
  - Privacy Policy
  - Invoices, contracts, and similar documents
  - Use **`Gopala Sales Management Pvt Ltd`** here as the legal entity name, optionally alongside `SalesSuite` (e.g. “SalesSuite is a product of Gopala Sales Management Pvt Ltd”).

## Restrictions

- Do **not** mention “Gopala” or `Gopala Sales Management Pvt Ltd` in regular UI, marketing, or product copy (only in clearly legal contexts above).
- When in doubt, default to **`SalesSuite`** with this exact casing.
